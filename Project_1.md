### Choropleth_Map
Plot 1 contains a map of Belize in 2019. This plot consists of the level one administrative subdivisions (adm1s) of Belize. 
Each subdivision is labelled and colored according to the density of its population size.

### Geometric_Bar_Plot
Plot 2 is a barplot that indicates the share of the total population located within that subdivision. The y-axis labels each adm1 subdivision, while the x-axis represents the population size.

### Analysis: 
Looking at these two plots led me to focus on the adm1 subdivision of Cayo. Plot 1 demonstrated that Cayo had a median-observed population, as it was the only orange color-coded subdivision. The Belize (adm1) district contained the former capital of Belize (i.e. Belize city). This area seen in Plot 1 is more coastal than that of Cayo. It is highly populated in part because of that as well as its culture, which likely attracts tourism. However, the capital was moved after a hurricaine to Belmopan which is located in the Cayo division. I believed that the distribution of the population across the Cayo division would allow me to map more defacto settlements. This area also gave me the possibility to integrate Mexico into the map boundaries, although, there was not enough time to progress that far. 

### Defacto Settlement Boundaries
Plot 3, Access to Health Care in Cayo, Belize, is a map of Cayo, an adm1 subdivision of Belize. Inside the map are the 6 settlements of Cayo represened by the dark gold region. Within the settlements there are color-coded dots signifying the population of the settlement. The color of the dot represents the density of the population where it is located.

### Analysis:
The map demonstrates 6, of the 8, defacto settlements. The majority of the settlements are in the northern portion of the division. The largest settlement is in the northeast part of the Cayo division. This region is likely the city of Belmopan, where a large number of residents are government employees and their families. This division borders Mexico which is indicative of the primary road's direction. San Ignacio is another major city in cayo shown by the large orange dot, representing a population of close to 20,000. Xunantunich is a city near the west edge of the Cayo district with a population of around 10,000 people. THis city's population is more densely populated than San Ignacio because it is among the Mayan Ruins.

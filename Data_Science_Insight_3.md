## Data Science Insight 3

An MIT News article, “Cracking open the black box of automated machine learning” describes a new tool that lets users interact with and see how automated searches work 
within a model. Normally, automated machine learning, also known  as AutoML, systems work as black boxes that prevent the user from seeing the inner workings of the 
system process.Though these systems are faster than the more time-consuming manual machine learning, they also may raise ‘trust issues’ in users due to the lack of 
transparency in this process. ATMSeer is meant to increase the transparency with these AI machine learning models.

ATMSeer is an interactive visualization system, which essentially opens the “black box” of AutoML processes. It allows the user to monitor the AutoML processes as it 
is happening. The user can then assess the given statistics of the algorithm and hyperparameter performance. Each different performance value is represented by a graph
(i.e. a horizontal histogram, a barplot, or a scatter plot). These additions to the AutoML platform not only increase the transparency of the process but also allow for
more interaction and control on the user side.

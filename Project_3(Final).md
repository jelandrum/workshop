# Final Project

## Introduction to Gravity Models:
### London Gravity Model/Practice Example
To begin my introduction to gravity models I followed a practice example. "Dr Ds Guide to Spatial Interaction Modelling for Dummies - Part 1: The Unconstrained (Total Constrained) Model" was the RPubs webpage that I followed to create a gravity model. This site had the code of Adam Dennett right in it along with descriptions of what the implementation of the codiing lines would accomplish. Census data for London was used to generate estimates of commuter flows according to transportation type. As a result of updated package commands likely, I was unable to run the travel network as an animation. However, I have included the distribution of the flows within the london data and its accompanying spatial interaction model's scatter plot graph with a best fit line (after logging the distance and total).

## Agent Based Modeling of Guatemala:
### Guatemala Gravity Model
Pursuant to my last project, I chose to generate a gravity model of Guatemala. In class, we read an article titled "Modeling internal migration flows in sub-Saharan Africa using census microdata" (Garcia et al.). Similar to the modeling outlined in this publication, my model of Guatemala will reflect an approximation of its internal migration flows. The model that I included below was produced from previously recorded migration data (i.e. from 2014). I combined the data I retrieved from WorldPop and my country's shapefiles in order to display the routes taken during travel between the states (or adm1 subdivisions) of Guatemala.

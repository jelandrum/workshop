# Final Project

## Introduction to Gravity Models:
### London Gravity Model/Practice Example
To begin my introduction to gravity models I followed a practice example. "Dr Ds Guide to Spatial Interaction Modelling for Dummies - Part 1: The Unconstrained (Total Constrained) Model" was the RPubs webpage that I followed to create a gravity model. This site had the code of Adam Dennett right in it along with descriptions of what the implementation of the codiing lines would accomplish. Census data for London was used to generate estimates of commuter flows according to transportation type.

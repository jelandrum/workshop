# Data Science Insight 2

  In an article titled “Deep Learning Takes on Tumours,” Esther Landhuis writes about how cancer research is advancing with the help of artificial intelligence methods. Guillaume Jacquemet, a cell biologist in Finland, tracks the movement of cancer cells. So with the rise in technology and ease of data collection, Jacquemet had an abundance of time-lapse microscopy films to track the nucleus of cells, however, the sheer amount of film frames proved to be a severely insurmountable undertaking manually. 

  Jacquemet only had minimal experience coding prior to using AI technology in his field. But, with the help of ZeroCostDL4Mic he was able to spot cell nuclei in massive microscopy data sets, after training a machine. ZeroCostDL4Mic is a free programming resource, including a compilation of multiple AI resources for scientists with little coding experience. This is a recently produced resource that makes use of Colab, a AI program through Google’s cloud service. Other programs are now being developed and updated to make way for a new lane data mapping in the medical field. One deep learning model worked on by experts across fields and gamers “learnt to discern cellular changes that are meaningful for drug discovery. Because the software wasn’t told what to look for, it found features that researchers hadn’t even considered. (Landhuis)” These new strides to integrate machine learning and medical data analysis opens a new door for the potential of programming capabilities.

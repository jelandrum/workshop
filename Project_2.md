# PROJECT 2: Generating Synthetic Population of Guatemala

## DHS Data Request
I am a William & Mary student taking a Agent Based Modeling course, for which I am constructing a model of Guatemala.The motivation of this research is to improve the use of multinomial logistic regression models to produce a descriptive synthetic population by determining, approximating and validating a continuous spatial model. Preliminarily, this data will be used to produce a synthetic population of Guatemala. I will describe land use and health care demand, as well as describe movement within Guatemala using the results from this model. By using remotely sensed data to estimate the dwelling locations across Guatemala and using survey data to estimate a spatially continuous multinomial, I will accomplish this research target. The DHS data will also help me investigate the interaction of settlements, households, roads, and health care facilities as a synergetic network.

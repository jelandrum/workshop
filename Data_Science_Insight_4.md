# Data Science Insight: 

The use of agent-based modeling techniques in data science have the potential to further advance our understanding of complex adaptive, economic and social systems. This was true when data science was emerging and is more so true today, as more data is produced and newer modeling methods are imagined. While more data is produced and collected, oftentimes it is also joined with modeling methods for additional analysis. Methods in data science allow for the scanning of cells for cancer or lungs for covid, modeling countries based on a number of descriptive statistics, covid tracking, and so much more. Data sciences’ reach on data applications is rapidly expanding as additional avenues of research are hypothesized and explored - this is how this field will continue to grow and flourish. 

In terms of human development, we have witnessed significant gains in our ability to analyze and predict its processes in recent years. This is in part due to the fact that the amount of data is increasing every day, accordingly, the complexity of data sets goes up as well. Data science methods like machine learning have come about because of that fact. For some research, such as Jacqement’s in the article “Deep Learning Takes on Tumours,” the sheer amount of data (film frames in this case) can prove to be a severely impossible task if done manually. Thus, training models to identify medical conditions or symptoms of disease/degradation as with the tumors provides an example for how data science can apply to the medical or environmental research, and more broadly.

An article titled “AI & big data: Opportunities for enhancing human development in Thailand and beyond” presents some examples of how AI has been used privately as well as addressing social challenges. One example this World Bank article provides is that “AI can revolutionize classrooms by providing individual learning pathways and virtual mentors.” This practical application of data science is one that could not be more necessary and beneficial for students than in our current time. Larger scale implementations of data science methods are what will be able to positively impact human development, learning, and understanding of its uses overall. The more new strides are taken to integrate machine learning and medical data analysis or AI and human development the more knowledge is created and the more new paths are paved in pursuit of the extraordinary and complex reach of programming capabilities.
